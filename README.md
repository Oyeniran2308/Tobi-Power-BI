### Analysis
- **Revenue Distribution Across Regions**
  - *Highest Revenue Regions:* The North East region consistently contributes the highest revenue across multiple metrics, with a total of 18.6 billion. Other regions like South West (15.8 billion) and South South (12.1 billion) also perform well. These regions should continue to be focal points for strategic growth.
  - *Lowest Revenue Region:* North Central has the lowest revenue contribution, generating only 6.4 billion. Despite this, there are opportunities for improvement by introducing more targeted marketing or tailored products to boost sales in this region.
- **Max and Min Revenue Insights**
  - *Max Revenue per Region:* The North West region records the highest maximum revenue in a single category, reaching 53.9 million, suggesting that certain high-revenue opportunities are being captured effectively in this region.
  - *Min Revenue per Region:* Revenue generation appears to be more spread out across regions with North Central registering the lowest revenue at 120 units, indicating a potential opportunity to address underperformance through market re-entry or realignment strategies.
- **Sales Performance by Line of Business**
  - Top Performing Line of Business: The Parts segment contributes the highest revenue with 75.6 billion, followed closely by Copier Sales with 75.4 billion. This highlights a strong demand for spare parts and copy machine equipment.
  - Service Plans Growth Opportunity: The Service Plan category generates the least revenue, totaling 51.8 billion, but it has room for growth. Companies may consider bundling services with hardware sales or offering long-term maintenance contracts to encourage higher revenue in this category.
  - Seasonal Revenue Insights: Sales of parts and copier sales peak during workdays and public holidays, while the printer sales line performs relatively well during local holidays, suggesting that businesses should target promotional campaigns during these periods to maximize sales.
