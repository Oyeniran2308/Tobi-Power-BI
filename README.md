- **Revenue Distribution Across Regions**
  - *Highest Revenue Regions:* The North East region consistently contributes the highest revenue across multiple metrics, with a total of 18.6 billion. Other regions like South West (15.8 billion) and South South (12.1 billion) also perform well. These regions should continue to be focal points for strategic growth.
  - *Lowest Revenue Region:* North Central has the lowest revenue contribution, generating only 6.4 billion. Despite this, there are opportunities for improvement by introducing more targeted marketing or tailored products to boost sales in this region.
- **Max and Min Revenue Insights**
  - *Max Revenue per Region:* The North West region records the highest maximum revenue in a single category, reaching 53.9 million, suggesting that certain high-revenue opportunities are being captured effectively in this region.
  - *Min Revenue per Region:* Revenue generation appears to be more spread out across regions with North Central registering the lowest revenue at 120 units, indicating a potential opportunity to address underperformance through market re-entry or realignment strategies.
- **Sales Performance by Line of Business**
  - *Top Performing Line of Business:* The Parts segment contributes the highest revenue with 75.6 billion, followed closely by Copier Sales with 75.4 billion. This highlights a strong demand for spare parts and copy machine equipment.
  - *Service Plans Growth Opportunity:* The Service Plan category generates the least revenue, totaling 51.8 billion, but it has room for growth. Companies may consider bundling services with hardware sales or offering long-term maintenance contracts to encourage higher revenue in this category.
  - *Seasonal Revenue Insights:* Sales of parts and copier sales peak during workdays and public holidays, while the printer sales line performs relatively well during local holidays, suggesting that businesses should target promotional campaigns during these periods to maximize sales.
- **Unit Sales Insights**
  - *Units Sold per Region:* North East sells the most units, reaching 208,893 units, followed by South West with 169,730 units sold. However, despite strong unit sales, North Central lags in revenue, suggesting that lower-priced or discounted products might be more popular here.
  - *Max Units Sold by Line of Business:* Service Plans sold the most units, at 244 units, indicating a high interest in after-sales support, but possibly lower profit margins as it contributes the least in terms of total revenue.
### Key Insights
- **Strategic Focus on Low-Performing Regions:** North Central and North West show underperformance in both revenue and units sold. Tailored marketing campaigns and sales initiatives could help boost sales in these regions.
- **High Dependency on Workdays:** The highest revenue generation happens on workdays, indicating reliance on business-to-business (B2B) transactions. Enhancing promotions on non-workdays (e.g., public holidays) could help increase sales during off-peak periods.
- **Diversification Opportunities:** While Copier and Parts sales are strong, Printer Sales lag behind. This might be a good area to focus marketing efforts or introduce competitive pricing and promotions.
- **Consistency in Sales Across Days:** Product lines such as Parts and Service Plans have consistent performance across all days, which indicates resilience. These could be leveraged to stabilize revenue during periods of lower sales in other categories.
