### Introduction
This project aims to analyze the sales performance of **Inhit. Nig Ltd** üè¢ across various states and regions using PowerBI. It also aims to evaluate the organization's business line performance, focusing on the highest units sold and revenue generated.
### Datasets
The Dataset used is a secondary data given by my tutor üë® ***(Mr. David)*** to draw business insight for the company.
### Tools Used
**Excel** was used to carry out the cleaning while PowerBi was the visualization of this project.
### Analysis
- Revenue Distribution Across Regions
  - Highest Revenue Regions: The North East region consistently contributes the highest revenue across multiple metrics, with a total of 18.6 billion. Other regions like South West (15.8 billion) and South South (12.1 billion) also perform well. These regions should continue to be focal points for strategic growth.
  - Lowest Revenue Region: North Central has the lowest revenue contribution, generating only 6.4 billion. Despite this, there are opportunities for improvement by introducing more targeted marketing or tailored products to boost sales in this region.
